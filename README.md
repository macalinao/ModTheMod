ModTheMod ![Build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/THEDevTeam/ModTheMod.png?branch=master)
=========

Introduction
--------------
**ModTheMod** is a mod made for the [Spout](http://spout.org/) modding API that allows smaller mods to be made in various scripting languages relatively quickly.

Often times, it is rather unreasonable to make a mod in Java, having to maintain a JAR with only two or three lines of code. Furthermore, Java is a rather verbose language, so it takes time out of making your ideas work out well.

The ultimate goal of ModTheMod is to provide a lightweight but powerful modding system for Spout.

Building
--------
ModTheMod can be built with the
[Java Development Kit](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) and
[Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org). Maven is also used for dependency
management.

The command `mvn clean install` will build ModTheMod and install it to your 
local repository.

Installing
-------
Installing ModTheMod is as simple as dropping `ModTheMod.jar` into your plugin
directory.

Documentation
-------------
Javadocs can be generated by using the `mvn javadoc:javadoc` command in the
terminal. This utilizes Maven's javadoc plugin and may need to download
dependencies the first time it is run.
